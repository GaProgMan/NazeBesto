\section*{Japanese Text}
This document will contain some Japanese characters - either in the footnotes or translation notes that are provided. If you have been able to open the document, then your PDF reader should be able to display them without any problems. However, if you find that there are sections of garbled characters in place of Japanese characters, then you might need to install Asian character support for your reader.

\par Most kanji\footnote{Kanji are Chinese characters used in written Japanese. The translation of Kanji is ``Chinese Characters''} characters in this translation (mostly proper nouns) have ruby text\footnote{Ruby Text is the text placed near to a character to aid in phonetic pronunciation. More information on Ruby Text can be found here: \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_text}} placed above them to aid the reader in the correct phonetic reading of the characters. Most kanji have more than one reading, as such they are separated (in Japanese) into three categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Konyomi
\item Onyomi
\item Nanori
\end{itemize}

\par Dependant on the contextual meaning of the kanji, different readings of the character are used for the ruby text.
