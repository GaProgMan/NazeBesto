Purpose of the project:		I had recently purchased a copy of the Japanese
				book called なぜベストを尽くさないのか (refered
				to as "Naze Besto") and wanted to translate it,
				both for myself and for others to read.
							The translation will be
				typed as a TeX document and distributed free of
				charge. However, I will retain attribution
				rights for the translation of the text.
							This translation is not
				intended as a copyright infringement in anyway.
				It is simply being provided for those who wish
				to read the book, but don't have the language
				skills to read the original Japanese text.
							This project will give
				me a perfect opportunity to extend and build on
				my own Japanese language skills.
							As this is a project that
				I will be completing in my own free time, and the
				first translation project I have ever undertaken
				on this scale (a whole 200 page book) the updates
				to it might come sporadically at first.
							To compile this document,
				you will need a (La)TeX environment, with access
				to the following packages:
					* CJK
					* url
					* epigraph
							I would recommend both
				the TexWorks and TexLive programs for compilation,
				as they are free and available for most Operating
				Systems.
