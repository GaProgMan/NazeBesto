## Purpose of the project##
  I had recently purchased a copy of the Japanese book called なぜベストを尽くさないのか (refered to as "Naze Besto") and wanted to translate it, both for myself and for others to read.

  The translation will be typed as a TeX document and distributed free of charge. However, I will retain attribution rights for the translation of the text.

  This translation is not intended as a copyright infringement in anyway. It is simply being provided for those who wish to read the book, but don't have the language skills to read the original Japanese text.

  This project will give me a perfect opportunity to extend and build on my own Japanese language skills.

  As this is a project that I will be completing in my own free time, and the first translation project I have ever undertaken on this scale (a whole 200 page book) the updates to it might come sporadically at first.

  To compile this document, you will need a (La)TeX environment, with access to the following packages:
- CJK
- url
- epigraph

I would recommend both the TexWorks and TexLive programs for compilation, as they are free and available for most Operating Systems.
