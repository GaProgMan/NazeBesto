\chapter*{A Note From The Translator}
\subsubsection{Reasons for Translating This Book}
Firstly, hi. I'm Jamie and I'm a fan of the Japanese TV show Trick. When I found out that the books, written by the character Ueda Jiro, that are referenced in the show had actually been released I decided to make it my mission to purchase a copy of one of them.
\subsubsection{Who Are All These People?}
Trick is a Japanese comedy starring \ruby{阿}{あ}\ruby{部}{べ}\ruby{寛}{ひろし} (Abe Hiroshi) and \ruby{仲}{なか}\ruby{間}{ま}\ruby{由}{ゆ}\ruby{紀}{き}\ruby{恵}{え} (Nakama Yukie) as \ruby{上}{うえ}\ruby{田}{だ}\ruby{次}{じ}\ruby{郎}{ろう} (Ueda Jiro) and \ruby{山}{やま}\ruby{田}{だ}\ruby{奈}{な}\ruby{緒}{お}\ruby{子}{こ} (Yamada Naoko), respectively.
\par Ueda is a professor of Physics at Tokyo University and uses logic and physics as a basis for his understand of the world and the people within it. Whereas Naoko is a down on her luck, and (mostly) out of work magician, who uses intuition and her magical training to see through most illusions.
\par Ueda is contacted by people to help them to understand or debunk paranormal phenomena (for instance: curses, good luck charms, psychic abilities and miraculous feats of strength). He usually chickens out when he witnesses said phenomena and implores Naoko to help him explain what's happening.
\par Naoko is insulted by many of the characters due to her small breasts. She usually fights back with a jibe about Ueda's gigantic penis, or the fact that the wig that \ruby{矢}{や}\ruby{部}{べ}\ruby{謙}{けん}\ruby{三}{ぞ} (Yabe Kenzo) wears is has fallen off or looks obvious or out of place.
\par Yabe Kenzo is an inept Assistant Detective, sent from Tokyo to investigate the crimes that are related to the phenomena that Ueda and Naoko are trying to debunk. Yabe (also the Japanese word for ``stop'') is played by \ruby{生}{なま}\ruby{瀬}{せ}\ruby{勝}{かつ}\ruby{久}{ひせ} (Namase Katsuhise).
\par Naoko's Mother, 山田さとり (Yamada Satori) is a calligrapher who teaches the children of her home town about the power of the written word. She has an often hinted at but never explained, psychic connection with Naoko, and will often find a way of helping her daughter when she is in trouble. She is played by \ruby{野}{の}\ruby{際}{ぎわ}\ruby{陽}{よ}\ruby{子}{こ} (Nogiwa Yoko).
